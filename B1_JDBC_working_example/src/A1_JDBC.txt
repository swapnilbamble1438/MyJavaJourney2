JDBC is used to connect our application to Database
using JDBC API.

Java App---------JDBC Driver------DB

Java App has its own language
and DB has its own language so to make both
understands each other language we use JDBC 
like a translator to make communication between them.


Steps for DB connection 
1) load & register driver -> Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
2) create connection -> Drivermanager.getConnection("url","username","password");
			url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db.name
			username: root
			password: root
3) create statement/prepare statement -> PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("sqlquery");

4) execute SQL statement -> ps.executeQuery(); // select query
5) process the result -> ps.executeUpdate(); // insert,update,delete query
6) close the connection -> ps.close, con.close();
