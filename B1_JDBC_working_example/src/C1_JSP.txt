JSP

previously we do frontend work in servlet only.
and it was very difficult to design any html page 
inside servlet.
so backend and frontend was in the 
same servlet file so it was not a good practice
for big projects. thus Jsp was introduced.
JSP is also server side technology 
which is used to create dynamic web page.
so we can provide backend in servlet and
frontend in jsp so nowaday project creation is 
become easy because of Jsp.
JSP is an advance part of servlet.


inside servlet we embed html code 
using out.println("<h1>Hii</h1>");

inside jsp we embed java code
using JSP Tags.


=========================================================================

JSP points to remember:
-> Jsp stands for Java server pages
-> Jsp is a server side technology which is used to create
dynamic web pages
-> Jsp is an advanced version of servlet technology
-> to embe java code in JSP, we can use below tags:

1. Scriplet Tag: <% some Java code %>
2. Expression Tag: <%= an expression %>
3. Declartion Tag: <%! variable declaration & method definition %>
4. Directive Tag: <%@ directives %>
5. Comment Tag: <%- any Text -%>
6. Action Tags: <jsp: actionName />

Difference between Servlet & JSP:
-> Servlet is a java code.
   JSP is a HTML-based code.

-> It is hard to write code in Servlet.
   It's easier to code in JSP compared to servlets.

-> Servlets run faster than JSP.
   Jsp runs slower than servlet as it takes time to
   compile the program and convert into servlets.

-> In MVC architecture, servlets works as a controller.
   In MVC architecture, JSP works as a view for displaying
   output.

-> Servlet can accept all protocol requests, including HTTP.
   Jsp can only accept HTTP requests.

-> Modification in Servlet file is a time consuming due
   to reloading, recompliling, and restarting the server.
   JSP modification is fast, as you just need to click one
   refresh button.
