Get & Post
Get & Post are Http methods.

Http methods define the specific actions that can
be performed on the resources like Java or 
Servlet file, Image file, Document file etc.

i)GET method sends data through
the resource URL and thus it is
not secured...
ii)Get is slightly faster because the
values are sent in the header
iii)We can send very less data in case of
Get request because it adds the data to the
url and the length of a url is limited
(maximum url length is 2048 characters)
iv) in get case use doGet() method


i)POST method sends data through
the HTTP message body and thus
it is more secured...
ii)Post is slightly slow because the
values are sent in the request body,
in the format that the content type
specifies.
iii)We can send huge amount of data in
case of Post request, there is no restriction
iv) in post case use doPost() method
